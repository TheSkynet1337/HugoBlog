# The Task
The task for this project was to create both a locomotion as well as an interaction technique for use with the Meta Quest 2.

The locomotion technique should be used to move the player character through a virtual parkour.
In three locations of this parkour, the player would have to complete an interaction challenge using the interaction technique.

# The Idea
My Idea was to create a VR experience that could be used to exercise whilst sitting down.
A sitting exercise that came to mind which could be done in VR was rowing.
However, rowing is done backward and the player would have to turn around to see where they were going.
Since completion of the parkour was the goal of the experience, this would not be ideal.

The solution to this problem was to use a kayak instead of a rowboat.

To make the experience more exhausting the player would have to hold a pole in real life that is tracked within the game.
This could also increase the presence of the user.
