# Concept
To increase the presence of the user I wanted to create a pole that the player would have to hold in real life.
The pole would be tracked by the headset and would be used to interact with the game.

# Creating the Pole
I bought a two-meter-long pvc pipe and cut it to an appropriate length.
Using a Dremel I cut a groove into the pipe.

The ring of the controller sits in the groove and allows for a solid mount using a piece of duct tape.

In Unity the real-life pole is then lined up with the controller and paddle model.
For weights, I bought two 1kg wrist weights.
I was planning to attach these to the end of the pole but decided that it would suffice if the user whore them on their arms.

### Extra:

This was my first time using a Dremel and I learned why you should always wear eye protection while using one.
